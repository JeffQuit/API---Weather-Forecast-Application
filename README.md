## 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

Author: Jeff Quittman

Date May 2020

## Description:

The sixth project for the UCLA/Trilogy Full Stack Boot Camp that tasks the student with building an interactive weather dashboard that utalizes the OpenWeatherMap API to provide weather dashboard and forecasting for cities searched by the user of the App. The App has to log the recently searched
cities in a table below the search bar that can be clicked at a later time to search the weather of that particular city. Using the search bar will also instantly provide the weather for that city when submitted.

To provide this information, the app will make multiple calls to the OpenWeatherMaps API using both city name and Long/Lat coordinate values.
