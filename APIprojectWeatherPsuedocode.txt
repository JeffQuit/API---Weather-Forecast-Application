Psuedocode - Weather App


Assignment:
Your challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

Use the OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data for cities. 
The documentation includes a section called "How to start" that will provide basic setup and usage instructions. Use localStorage to store any persistent data.

User Story:
AS A traveler

I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities

SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly



Technology:
HTML
CSS Framework - Bulma (https://bulma.io/) - Inspired by Piere's Project 1 Group, going to give Bulma a try


Psuedo Code Notes:
Nav Bar Header with Weather Dashboard Title
Left Menu Panel with Searchbar at the top
Below this, City Panel Cities searched buttons that store into local. Use method from Schedule project to store to local for each city using variable
Center Content Container has today's Weather and 5 day forecast below it



Psuedo Code Steps:

1. Build HTML Template w/ CSS file and Jquery File 
2. Add Folder for Images/ Assets
3. Initalize with CDN Links 
	a. Jquery Google CDN - <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
	b. Font Awesome CDN
	c. Moment.js CDN - Take from Schedule Application
	d. Google Font - Titillium Web Font via Google
	e. Bulma CDN - https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/
4. Build Nav Bar w/ Bulma
5. Build Left Nav Panel w/ Bulma, Maybe make it reactive and have it animate to pull left when hovered over. 
6. Build Center Content Container 
7. Build 5 day forcast under Center Content Container
8. Initialize JS with API for Weather - Take API Key from Weather Activity
9. Create functionality for Search Bar
10. Create functionality for Searched Cities to be added to the recently searched cities table
11. Create functionality for the Cities in the table to be searchable 
	-Two ways to do this:
		1. Set ID for onClick for both the table and Search Icon to be the same ID so it searches which on you click w/ the ID
		2. Set functionality to add the city to the table first then pull up the data
12. Create functionality for selected city to display today's weather in the center content container
13. Create functionality for the 5 day forcaste to populate


Issues:
Need to convert City Name to Coordinates before you can access UV data
1. User submits name of city
2. City is logged to local array
3. when clicked, city name is stored as data attribute and Long and Lat can be found in the standard OpenWeatherMap Object
4. Long and Lad is then set as their own variables and ran again through openweather API to produce 5 day forecast, UV index, and general weather report for the day



UV Index - Per Google
0 to 2 - Low - Green
3 to 5 - Yellow - moderate
6 to 7 - Orange - high
8 to 10 - red - very high
11+ - violet - extreme
